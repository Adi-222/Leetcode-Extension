## The Problem It Solves

Every LeetCode user knows the struggle: you're stuck on a problem, and the "Solutions" and "Editorial" tabs are just one click away. While helpful, looking at the solution too soon robs you of a crucial learning opportunity. This extension acts as a self-imposed barrier, enforcing the focus you need to grow as a problem solver.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **üö´ Focus Mode:** Disables the "Solutions" tab, the "Editorial" tab, and the official "Solution" beaker icon, making them completely unclickable.
*   **‚è±Ô∏è Customizable Timer:** Use the clean popup UI to set a lock duration. The buttons will remain disabled until the timer expires.
*   **Visual Countdown:** When a timer is active, the popup displays a clear, large countdown, showing you exactly how much focus time is left.
*   **Manual Override:** You can stop the timer at any point from the popup if you need to access the solutions.
*   ** motivational Messages:**
    *   When you start a timer, a toast message appears on the page: **"Choose Harder Right over Easier Wrongs"**.
    *   If you end the timer manually, a system notification appears: **"YEH Programmer Banega Reh"**.
